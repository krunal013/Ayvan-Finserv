      question: "What are Fixed Deposit?",
      answer:
        "A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a financial instrument offered by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) where you deposit a lump sum amount for a fixed tenure at a predetermined interest rate. It is considered a low-risk investment because the returns are guaranteed.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do Fixed Deposit work?",
      answer:
        "Fixed Deposits (FDs) work by allowing you to deposit a lump sum amount with a bank or financial institution for a predetermined period at a fixed interest rate. At the end of the tenure, you receive your principal amount along with the accrued interest.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of investing in Fixed deposit?",
      answer:"Investing in a Fixed Deposit (FD) offers several benefits, making it a preferred choice for risk-averse investors.

  Support: [
    {
      question: "How do I choose the right Fixed Deposit?",
      answer:
        "Choosing the right Fixed Deposit (FD) requires careful consideration of several factors to ensure it aligns with your financial goals. The first step is to determine the purpose of your FD investmentâ€”whether it is for short-term savings, regular income, tax benefits, or long-term wealth accumulation. Once your goal is clear, compare interest rates offered by different banks and financial institutions, as higher interest rates will maximize your returns.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are Fixed Deposit risky?",
      answer:
        "Fixed Deposits (FDs) are generally considered one of the safest investment options since they offer guaranteed returns and are not affected by market fluctuations. Unlike stocks or mutual funds, where returns depend on market performance, an FD provides a fixed interest rate for the chosen tenure, ensuring stability.",
    },

  Others: [
    {
      question: "What fees are associated with Fixed deposit?",
      answer:
        "Fixed Deposits (FDs) generally do not have upfront fees, but certain charges may apply in specific situations. If you withdraw your FD before maturity, banks typically impose a premature withdrawal penalty ranging from 0.5% to 1% on the applicable interest rate. Some banks also charge a cancellation fee for auto-renewed FDs if withdrawn within a few days.",
